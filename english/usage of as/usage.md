# USAGE OF 'AS'

![as](./summary.jpg)

## 1. 副词

as作为副词时，表示“同样地”意思。一般用来修饰形容词或者副词。例子：

> The book is **as** good
>
>这本书同样地好

## 2. 连词

as作连词时，连接两个完整的句子，并且此时as一般引导状语从句。

### 2.1 as 引导比较状语从句

> He sings as sweetly as Jenny. 

这个句子的第一个as做副词，第二个as做连词，引导比较状语从句。看起来Jenny并不是一个完整的句子，其实是因为部分成分被省略了，完整的句子如下：

> He sings as sweetly as Jenny sings sweetly.

为了严谨，这里省略的部分可用助动词代替：

> He sings as sweetly as Jenny does.

as 做连词时常常会出现【倒装】的情况

> Keats' letters are as much an indication of the man as is his poetry. （正常语序是 his poetry is)

as 后面的从句主语是【his poetry】，谓语是 is，为了避免头重脚轻，选择倒装。

### 2.2 as 引导方式状语从句，译作【方式如同...一样】

> He did not go to office daily, as his father did before.
>
> 他不像他父亲从前那样每天去办公室

### 2.3 as 引导时间状语从句，译作【随着...】

> As you are leaving last, please turn out the lights.

### 2.4 as 引导让步状语从句，译作【尽管】

as引导让步状语从句，需用部分倒装，一般将表语、状语或实义动词前置

#### 1. 表语前置

> Enviable as the cool kids may have seemed, Dr. Prinstein's studies show unpleasant consequences.
>
> 虽然这些酷孩子看起来令人羡慕，但普林斯坦博士的研究显示出了令人不快的后果

#### 2. 状语前置

> As much as some scientists may complain about the new awards, two things seem clear.

#### 3. 实义动词前置

> Try as he might, he could not forget it.
